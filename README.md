ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Matthew Braun, a soon-to-be graduate in Computer Engineering from the University of Alberta, graduating in April 2024. With a passion for technology and innovation, I've embarked on a journey through various facets of the tech industry, from software development to operations engineering. Here's a snapshot of what I've done and what I can bring to the table:

ðŸ’¼ Professional Experiences
Software Development and Engineering: During my internship with Alberta Electric System Operator (AESO), I dove deep into the world of energy market simulations. I crafted a Python-based model to simulate Alberta's power grid, embracing the shift towards renewable energy. Through designing UML diagrams and managing a comprehensive MS SQL database, I honed my skills in Python, database management, and data analysis, utilizing libraries like Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and PySAM.

Web Development: At DevFacto, as a Software Consultant, I leveraged my expertise in C#, .NET Framework, SQL databases, React Framework, and TypeScript to develop and maintain robust web applications. Working within an agile environment, I practiced SCRUM methodologies, contributing to a team that valued collaboration, client consultation, and continuous delivery through Azure DevOps.

Technical Support and IT Solutions: My role as a Worksite Support Technician for Compugen sharpened my problem-solving skills, providing technical support to Government of Alberta employees. This position solidified my understanding of network diagnostics, hard drive recovery, and hardware troubleshooting, laying a strong foundation for my technical acumen.
